# Cottage Booking Service - Frontend & Ontology

## Project Overview

This is a cottage booking web application for TIES4520 course, Task 6.

## My Contributions

- OWL Ontology design (CottageOntology.owl)
- RDF Data instances (CottageData.ttl)
- Frontend user interface (HTML, CSS, JavaScript)

## Files Structure

- `scripts/` - Contains OWL ontology and RDF data files
- `public/` - Contains frontend files (HTML, CSS, JS)

## How to View the Frontend

1. Navigate to the `public` folder
2. Open `index.html` in any web browser

## Backend Integration

The backend is being developed by other team members. Once complete:

- Replace the sample data in `script.js` with actual API calls
- Update the fetch URL to point to the backend server

## Technologies Used

- Protégé 5.6.7 for ontology creation
- HTML5 for structure
- CSS3 for styling
- JavaScript for interactivity
- RDF/Turtle notation for data

## Notes

- The frontend currently displays sample data
- Backend team will integrate SPARQL queries and connect to RDF database
